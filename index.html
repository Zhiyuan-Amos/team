      <h2>Manager of one</h2>
      <blockquote>A manager of one is someone who comes up with their own goals and executes them. They don't need heavy direction... They do what a manager would do — set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.</blockquote>

      <h2>Collaborate early and often</h2>
      <blockquote>Don't be the guy coding in the dark office emerging only to buy cola. The guy in the room is out of touch, out of sight, and out of control and has no place in an open, collaborative environment.</blockquote>

      <h2>No room for ego</h2>
      <blockquote>Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you do turn out to be right, don't take revenge or say, "I told you so" more than a few times at most, and don't make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry.</blockquote>

      <h2>Writing solidifies, chat dissolves</h2>
      <blockquote>Substantial decisions start and end with an exchange of complete thoughts, not one-line-at-a-time jousts. If it's important, critical, or fundamental, write it up, don't chat it down.</blockquote>

      <h2>Communicate</h2>

      <h2>Disagree and commit</h2>
      <blockquote>Consensus is cozy, but broad agreement is not our aim. The right decision is. Which is why we take the time to think, debate, persuade, listen and reconsider and then, someone, decides. If you disagree, that's fine, but once the decision is made, it's time to commit and support it completely.</blockquote>

      <h2>Protect your time</h2>
      <blockquote>We limit ourselves to a 40-hour work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters... There are occasions when teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance, or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.</blockquote>
